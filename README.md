# Playdate - version 2

## An app designed for busy parents to help them plan activities with their kids and friends.

---

As a busy parent, sometimes finding things to do for your kids is a full-time job. This application uses a combination of a user's current location as well as the weather at that location to provide quick and easy recommendations for kid-friendly activities. Users can also invite their friends to meetup for playdates now or in the future.

## How to use

When first coming to the site, users will immediately be given a map with nearby activities that are appropriate for the current weather conditions. Users can then click on a location and invite other friends to meet them at that location for a playdate.
